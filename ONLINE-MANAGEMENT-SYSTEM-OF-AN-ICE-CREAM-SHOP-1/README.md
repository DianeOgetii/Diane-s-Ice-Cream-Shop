## objectives
- To develop an efficient system that can monitor sales of ice cream
- To develop and maintain a graphical user interface that show available itemz
- To keep track of employees and customers
-  enter details request and transactions and preserve soft copy of records

## requirements 

### Functional requirements
According to my review, These are elements that specify particular results of a system in order to make it usable.
According to my review, These are elements that specify particular results of a system in order to make it usable. They include end user requirements. In this case the end users involve shopkeeper, customer and overall members. Some of the functional requirements include placing an order, checking available stock in terms of ice cream flavour available (menu), feedback, receipts, contacts of the ice cream shop. End user accounts, login procedure such as email and password as well as verification of the account. The prices of stock available is also included in the functional requirements.

####functional requirement testing
Unit testing will be done  to measure if my modules work right. Integration testing to ensure all modules can successfully pass data to one another and to the database. I will also conduct system testing to ensure the system works as designed in the low lev

### Non-functional requirements
They are contrastedwith functional requirements that define specific behaviour or functions hence will not affect the usablility of the system.
They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behaviour or functions hence will not affect the usability of the system. They can also be described as a specification that describes the systemâ€™s operation capabilities and constraints that enhance overall functionality
They include;
1. Platform compatibility
2. System security
3. Performance
4. Capacity
5. Maintainability
6. Serviceability

#### non functional requirement testing
I intend to use bare metal deployment technique where I am going to create an executable file for my system and run it on my laptop or any other windows based workstation machine.

### Technicalities 
The entire code has been written using c++ language. I have also used xamp to create the system database and link them together with the system. By using c++  I have been able to declare variables at the beginning of the code so as to understand segments of the code. C++ and xamp have highly contributed to the development of this system code
